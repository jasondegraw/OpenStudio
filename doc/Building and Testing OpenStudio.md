Process of Building and Testing OpenStudio for Release
======================================================
Configured build environments: https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/Configuring-OpenStudio-Build-Environments

- 64-bit Windows environment
- 64-bit Ubuntu environment
- 64-bit OS X environment
- Git
- VMWare
- IncrediBuild
- S3
- SketchUp
- MarkdownPad 2


Release Notes
=============
If this is a major release, release notes must be written.

- Contact each OpenStudio developer and get from them a list of features and bug fixes which they feel should be highlighted.
- In the folder doc\ReleaseNotes copy the most recent release notes, and update the name to reflect the correct version, and date.
- Incorporate the developers notes previously obtained.
- Have the release notes reviewed for accuracy.
- Generate a PDF from the word doc.
- With Git, commit above files (Commit Message = `Updating release notes X.Y.Z`) to the develop branch
- Generate a markdown document from the word doc.


Initial Steps
=============
If internal to NREL, connect to developer VPN (avoids certificate warnings, increases speed of uploads).

- With Git, merge `develop` into `iteration`.

If this is a major release

- With Git, merge `develop` into `master`.


Updating EnergyPlus
===================

If a new version of EnergyPlus is to be incorporated into OpenStudio
- Upload the 4 versions (Windows 64, Windows 32, Ubuntu, and Linux) to S3's folder `openstudio-resources/dependencies`
- In the top level of your OpenStudio folder, update `CMakeLists.txt` following
	- ENERGYPLUS_VERSION_MAJOR
	- ENERGYPLUS_VERSION_MINOR
	- ENERGYPLUS_VERSION_PATCH
	- ENERGYPLUS_BUILD_SHA
	- ENERGYPLUS_EXPECTED_HASH (In 4, perhaps 5 places: Win 32, Win 64, Darwin, Linux, and maybe Redhat)

Note: use HashTab, or similar, to determine the MD5 hash value for each file referenced above.

- At https://www.openstudio.net/ click "Add Announcement" and publish a release note.

OpenStudio-Web Update
=====================

If this is a major release, OpenStudio-web must be updated

In the docroot folder\

- open update.html and update its build version, sha, and date (2 places)


Final Steps

Commit GitHubIssueStats.rb and CHANGELOG.md to the develop branch


Version Update
==============

The current version (X.Y.Z) being built, and the updated version (X.Y.Z+1) for the upcoming iteration need to be correctly incorporated into their respective documents.

- In `build\OSCore-prefix\src\OSCore-build\resources\osversion` copy directory X.Y.Z to `openstudiocore\resources\osversion` (new folder, 3 files)
- In the top level of your OpenStudio folder, update `CMakeLists.txt` version to X.Y.Z+1 (1 line)
- In `openstudiocore\resources` update `CMakeLists.txt` version to X.Y.Z (3 lines, 1 location)
- In `openstudiocore\resources\model` update `OpenStudio.idd` version to X.Y.Z+1 (1 line)
- In `openstudiocore\src\osversion` update `VersionTranslator.cpp` version to X.Y.Z+1 in first location, and X.Y.Z in second location

At https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/blob/develop/openstudiocore/src/osversion/VersionTranslator.cpp

- Select "History", see edits if needed (usually use `defaultUpdate` in first location, 1 line for each of 2 locations)

With Git, commit above files (Commit Message = `Updating version to X.Y.Z+1`) to the develop branch

SketchUp Extension Signature
=========
If either of the files '/openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/sketchup_plugin/OpenStudio.rb' or '/openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/sketchup_plugin/Startup.rb' change, then the SketchUp Extension Signature in '/openstudiocore/ruby/openstudio/sketchup_plugin/OpenStudio.hash' must be updated.  To do this:

- Build an OpenStudio package
- Copy all the files in '\Ruby\Plugins' to another directory (you should see OpenStudio.rb and an OpenStudio folder)
- Delete the 'OpenStudio.hash' file in the copied directory
- Zip the OpenStudio.rb and OpenStudio folders (with OpenStudio.rb being at the top level of the zip archive)
- Change the extension of the zip file from .zip to .rbz
- Login to https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer_center/extension_signature as openstudio@nrel.gov
- Drag the .rbz file into the upload box, upload the file, push the 'Sign The Extension' button (do not select any options to encrypt the ruby files)
- Download the signed .rbz file, extract all the files
- Copy the new OpenStudio.hash file over the existing one in the source tree, commit the new OpenStudio.hash file
- Rebuild the OpenStudio package

AMI BUILD
=========
On first use, install the required gems using a command prompt, with Ruby in the PATH.

- In the top level of your OpenStudio-server folder, run

```ruby
gem install bundler
bundler install
```

With Git, make feature branch of OpenStudio-server develop, and name it "OS.x.y.z.sha"

- In `server\lib\openstudio_server\version.rb`, update VERSION_EXT to `-OS.x.y.z.sha` (ex: `-OS.1.12.2.462ae9e746`).
- In `CHANGELOG.md`, add new server and openstudio versions (ex: `Version 1.19.1-OS.1.12.2.462ae9e746`, `OpenStudio 1.12.2.462ae9e746`).
- In `vagrant\chef\roles\openstudio.rb`, update version and version_revision (ex: `1.12.2`, `462ae9e746`) 

With Git, commit above files to new branch (Commit Message = `Bump OpenStudio version to OS.x.y.z.sha`)
With Git, submit pull request

In a command window:

- In the top level of your OpenStudio-server folder, run `rake release`

Compatibility Matrix
====================
On https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/wiki/OpenStudio-Version-Compatibility-Matrix

- Select `Edit` and add a new row of information


Docker Image
============

In the top level of your docker-openstudio folder, modify `Dockerfile`

- Update OPENSTUDIO_VERSION with current version (X.Y.Z)
- Update OPENSTUDIO_SHA with current SHA
- (optional) test that the new Dockerfile works by running `docker build -t test-openstudio .` after starting the docker-machine to make sure that it completes successfully

With Git, commit Dockerfile (Commit Message = Bump OpenStudio version to OS.x.y.z.sha)
 
Verify master branch built successfully at https://hub.docker.com/r/nrel/openstudio/builds/

In a command window:
- In the top level of your docker-openstudio folder, run `git tag -a X.Y.Z` and annotate with 'X.Y.Z Release'
